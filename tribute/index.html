			<h3><span>Ernesto "Che" Guevara, born June 14, 1928, was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader,
				diplomat and military theorist. A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural
				symbol of rebellion and global insignia in popular culture.</span> 
				<span>As a young medical student, Guevara traveled throughout South America and was radicalized by the poverty, hunger and
				disease he witnessed. His burgeoning desire to help overturn what he saw as the capitalist exploitation of Latin America
				by the United States prompted his involvement in Guatemala's social reforms under President Jacobo Árbenz, whose eventual
				CIA-assisted overthrow at the behest of the United Fruit Company solidified Guevara's political ideology. Later in Mexico
				City, Guevara met Raúl and Fidel Castro, joined their 26th of July Movement and sailed to Cuba aboard the yacht Granma
				with the intention of overthrowing U.S.-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.</span> 
				<span>Guevara soon rose to prominence among
				the insurgents, was promoted to second in command and played a pivotal role in the victorious two-year guerrilla campaign
				that deposed the Batista regime.</span></h3>
